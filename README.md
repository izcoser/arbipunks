Arbipunks Reboot - with images on IPFS.

The creators of Arbipunks have rugged the project by storing images on a server and later abandoning it, making the images unavailable.


This reboot aims to create a new version of Arbipunks with data stored on IPFS. Owners of the original rugged Punks can re-mint their Punks at no cost, except for platform fees.
